* **Need for Customer Feedback Analysis**: Understanding customer opinions about products and services is crucial for improving engagement and conversion.

#### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

* **Conversion Rate**: Percentage of website visitors who make a purchase.
* **Customer Engagement Rate**: Level of interaction with marketing content (clicks, likes, comments).
